/*

A string is said to be beautiful if each letter in the string appears at most as many times as the previous letter in the alphabet within the string; ie: b occurs no more times than a; c occurs no more times than b; etc. Note that letter a has no previous letter.

Given a string, check whether it is beautiful.

Example

For inputString = "bbbaacdafe", the output should be solution(inputString) = true.

This string contains 3 as, 3 bs, 1 c, 1 d, 1 e, and 1 f (and 0 of every other letter), so since there aren't any letters that appear more frequently than the previous letter, this string qualifies as beautiful.

For inputString = "aabbb", the output should be solution(inputString) = false.

Since there are more bs than as, this string is not beautiful.

For inputString = "bbc", the output should be solution(inputString) = false.

Although there are more bs than cs, this string is not beautiful because there are no as, so therefore there are more bs than as.

function solution(inputString) {
	let s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
	for (i = 1; i < s.length; i++) {
		if (
			inputString.split(s[i]).length - 1 >
			inputString.split(s[i - 1]).length - 1
		) {
			return false;
		}
	}
	return true;
}
