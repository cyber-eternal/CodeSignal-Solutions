/*

You're given three integers, a, b and c. It is guaranteed that two of these integers are equal to each other. What is the value of the third integer?

Example

For a = 2, b = 7, and c = 2, the output should be
solution(a, b, c) = 7.

The two equal numbers are a and c. The third number (b) equals 7, which is the answer.

function solution(a, b, c) {
	return a == b ? c : a == c ? b : a;
}
